# All About Me

I started this repo as a place to hold and track information on me as a developer for my benefit alone, originally holding just my coding principles.  Shortly after I decided to make it public, and announced it to my team almost as an experiment in openness where I tried to expose my thought process to critique from my peers - no matter how controversial some of those items were.

During the process of leaving Greenbyte and moving abroad (my partner is starting a PhD) I thought I'd take the experiment one step further and use it as a job-seeking tool, and in turn use the additional exposure as further motivation to expand the repo and clean it up a bit.

Pull-requests and issues very welcome.
